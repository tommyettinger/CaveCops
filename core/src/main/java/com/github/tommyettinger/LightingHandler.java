/**
 * A convenience class that makes dealing with multiple colored light sources easier.
 * All fields are public and documented to encourage their use alongside the API methods. The typical usage case for
 * this class is when a game has complex lighting needs that should be consolidated into one LightingHandler per level,
 * where a level corresponds to a {@code char[][]}. After constructing a LightingHandler with the resistances for a
 * level, you should add all light sources with their positions, either using {@link #addLight(int, int, Radiance)} or
 * by directly putting keys and values into {@link #lights}. Then you can calculate the visible cells once lighting is
 * considered (which may include distant lit cells with unseen but unobstructing cells between the viewer and the light)
 * using {@link #calculateFOV(Coord)}, which should be called every time the viewer moves. You can update the flicker
 * and strobe effects on all Radiance objects, which is typically done every frame, using {@link #update()} or
 * {@link #updateAll()} (updateAll() is for when there is no viewer), and once that update() call has been made you can
 * call {@link #draw(float[][])} to change a 2D float array that holds packed
 * float colors (which may be used in some custom setup). To place user-interface lighting effects that don't affect the
 * actual FOV of creatures in the game, you can use {@link #updateUI(Coord, Radiance)}, which is called after
 * {@link #update()} but before {@link #draw(float[][])}.
